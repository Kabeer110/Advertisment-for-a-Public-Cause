# Advertisment-for-a-Public-Cause
Poster to promote adoption of stray dogs.
I am so glad to announce that I came in touch with the Safe Home Foundation which is a charity organization that works tirelessly to rescue stray dogs and improve their
lives. In order to promote this essential cause I decided to put my skills to use and I made a poster with the knowledge of HTML and CSS to promote the adoption of stray
dogs. As a dog lover and one who cares for their well-being, I urge people to adopt street dogs! Adoption is not only about keeping a pet inside the home but one can also
do that by helping and taking care of territorial dogs. It will not only improve the lives of these stray dogs but also provide you with a loyal friend.
